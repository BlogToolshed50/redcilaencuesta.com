How to have happy friends? This is a very important question. Who likes friends who don&#8217;t smile and laugh? Who enjoys meeting friends who look serious? Not any one of us. What about ourselves? Do we make happy friendships? Do we make our friends happy?

Before thinking about others, wouldn&#8217;t it be better if we first analyze our own selves? Do we smile more often when we are with our friends? Do we laugh at the smallest joke? Or do we have a serious expression on our face all the time with our friends? Let us first think about our own behavior and correct whatever we can.

To make happy friendships, make yourself look happy with your friends and your friends will reflect your behavior. That is the secret of happy friendship. Our emotions are reflected in our body language. The reverse is equally true. Does this help us? It does. It can change our state of mind by changing our physical state. For example, if you are feeling bored, try to look cheerful and you will start becoming cheerful. It is strange, but it works. If you are feeling sad, try to look happy. You will find the sadness going away. Isn&#8217;t it great?

How do we talk with friends? Happiness also depends on what do we talk with our friends. Are we always talking of our own life or do we also listen to them. Listening is the best way to make friends happy. Listen and do it carefully. No pretensions. Your friends will be happy that someone heard them out without interruption. You will also be making your friendship stronger. Listening is very good. By listening, we make the other person feel important. we also make him/her feel happy and relieved. By talking things out, one feels relieved. Isn&#8217;t it?
