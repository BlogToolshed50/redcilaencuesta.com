When we undergo the energy crisis with abnormal cost and environmental pollution, we think about conserving the energy efficiently and store it properly. The recent article on the &#8220;super Batteries&#8221; contemplated by Dan Li of Monash University re assures the human being sore the energy and release it efficiently. His team is working on an effective energy storage system using the graphite and water which are readily available at a cheaper cost.

They are trying to develop the super batteries adopting a simple technique which can be easily scaled up. The new product from the team is certain to provide the ultra fast energy storage system to the next generation. You may be in a position to charge your iPhone or the mobile in a few seconds by the information on the proposed invention. It may also give a long lifespan to the energy storage system to be more cost effective. Such products are vital for the proper storage of the electricity from the renewable energy sources.
