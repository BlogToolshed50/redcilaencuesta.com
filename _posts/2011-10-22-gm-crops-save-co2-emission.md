The advantages of crop bio technology is found in the saving of the CO2 emission according to the study of the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri bio tech Applications. James, who is the disciple of Nobel laureate Norman Borlaug too underlined the importance of growing genetically modified crops. According to the data, 15.4 million farmers in about 29 countries had grown GM crops in 148 million hectares in 2010.

The estimate available, the genetically modified crops grown around the world in 2009 could save about 18 billion Kg of CO2 emission. This is equivalent to 8 million cars going off the road, which is substantial. Agriculture is the cause of deforestation emitting 14% of the greenhouse gas in the globe. The problem of climate change can be tackled by growing the genetically modified crops by the recent research.
