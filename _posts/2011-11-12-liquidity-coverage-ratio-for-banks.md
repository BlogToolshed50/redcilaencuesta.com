In the recent days, many nations are conducting the stress test on the banks in their country to avoid the financial crisis we had seen during 2008. The Basel committee on banking reforms too introduces lots of frame work for liquidity risk management to cope up with the international standard to help the banks to take the needed precautions. The recent introduction of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio aims to ensure that a bank maintains an adequate level of unencumbered, high quality assets that can be converted in to cash to meet the liquidity needs.

At a minimum, the stock of liquid assets should enable the bank to survive until day 30 of the proposed stress scenario, by which time it is assumed that appropriate actions can be taken by the management. The specified scenario entails both institutions specific and systemic shocks built upon actual circumstances experienced in the global financial crisis. It is high time that the policy makers try to implement such stringent standards in the banking sector to ensure smooth recovery of global economy.
