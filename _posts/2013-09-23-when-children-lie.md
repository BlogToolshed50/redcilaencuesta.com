When your child has lied to you, the teacher or friend, the effect is null, disappointing or catastrophic. It’s important to deal with lies, but to know the appropriate reaction it is helpful to know what kind of lie the child has said. There are many kinds of lies and some are “worst” than others. Whether or not it is a problem depends on the type of lie, the context, the frequency, the motive, and the age of the child.

As young as pre-school age, children learn to be “less honest” as they enter the world of social acceptability. For example, they learn to restrain the remarks about Aunt Lily being so heavy, or grandpa looking so old, or saying “I’m sorry” to get out of trouble even though they do not mean it. Therefore, for young children to learn the difference between social acceptability and lying is a difficult task. Not to justify the lying, but let’s define it: is an intentional falsehood.

There are also different kinds of lies. One is Instrumental Lying- these are deliberate attempts to deceive another person to get out of trouble, get a reward or avoid blame. Another form of lying is Noninstrumental Lying- under this category we have two types: Wishful thinking and Compulsive Lying. Wishful thinking is common in young children and it expresses their desire that things were different. If we listen to the context, theme and wish we can help the child overcome their difficulties and worries. The other type, Compulsive Lying is the child that knows’ they are lying but the motive eludes them (and you). They lie about everything with no apparent gain. Even though rare, this type of lying falls under impulse control. Then we have, Prosocial Lying – used to avoid hurting someone’s feelings. Although a lie, the motive is positive. And last, Unintentional Lying. Here we have three types. First, Fantasy- the child cannot distinguish between fantasy and reality; sometimes common in young children, but problematic if it continues beyond elementary age. Second-Unconscious defense, used to avoid admitting a wrong doing and last, Accidental Falsehood- lying based on false information, which is our day to day gossip and misinterpretation of events.

Understanding the context of lies gives you direction on how to manage it. It may keep you from overreacting. The important thing to understand is that a child’s lying is complex and may not be a psychological problem in itself, but an indication of other problems, such as social problems, self-esteem, avoidance behaviors, perfectionism etc. In the long run, lying affects relationships, moral development, and social adjustment and can interfere with academic achievement.
