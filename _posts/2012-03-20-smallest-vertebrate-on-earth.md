Have you seen a frog that can be perched on the tip of your pinkie with room to spare?.Yes, it is there in the world and claimed to be the smallest vertebrate species. In an article published in the journal of PLoS One named Paedophryne amanuensis declared as the world&#8217;s smallest animal with a spine. In fact, the frog, which is adult in stature is measuring about three tenths of an inch and a millimeter smaller than a carp found on the island of Sumatra.

According to the University of Washington ichthyologist, the males of a species of deep sea angler fish are about 2mm smaller. It is a wonder to see the males without stomach and they live as parasites on long females. Scientist stumbled upon this small frog while on a trip to Papua New Guinea. It is in fact a wonder to come across such wild life on earth surviving the various odds they confront.
