Do you sometimes feel scattered? Are you anxious about many things? Do you have questions about your purpose and your mission in life? Would you like to become more grounded, focused and relaxed? Do you have a desire to feel more connected on a soul level? Are you concerned about your overall state of health? Do you feel as though something is missing?

Have you ever come to a place where you feel disoriented about your direction in life? It’s as if you come to a screeching halt, like hitting a wall! You ask yourself, what am I doing? Where am I going in my life? How will I get there? Confusion and frustration set in and life becomes this giant puzzle, something is missing!

Fear creeps in and overwhelming thoughts race through your mind. You begin to panic, as your heart pounds. The feelings are coming out of nowhere. Your desire is to run, but there is no safe place in sight.

Stop… Breathe… Accept the feeling… Give yourself permission to feel anxious… Calm yourself with positive self-talk… Let Go!

If you have ever experienced this before it’s O.K. In fact, it’s necessary. Anxiety is a trigger to let you know you are headed in the wrong direction. It is a compass in life to get you back on course. When the feelings come…Stop…Breathe… then recognize why you’re experiencing these feelings and surrender to them. This does not mean giving up or giving in, it simply means letting go. Accept and trust the reason this occurred. Be still, be quiet, and meditate on this. Peace is the answer. When conflict arises, seek peace, the absence of conflict.

&#8221; Seek Peace and Pursue it &#8221; Psalm 34:14

To obtain peace you must begin with a clean slate, a renewing of the mind from harmful emotions that can affect your body. You must cleanse your heart from bitterness, resentment, and lack of forgiveness. Peace is a sense of serenity, calmness, and balance within oneself. Be open to receive peace. This connects you to your inner counselor… the Holy Spirit. This is your guide to your purpose, assisting you in arriving at your goals.

Exploring and developing one’s inner self cultivates a foundation for peace. Discovering and giving gratitude for who you are becomes an extension of your behavior. Hope and joy are instilled within, the deepest form of happiness. This is given freely to others, easily, graciously, generously, simply by your presence. To be with one another in silent, calm communication, attracting new relationships. More powerful than words, effortlessly reaching each other’s souls. This is a passive side to peace, however, in order for peace to be maintained, you must be assertive. In the world today, one step can rob you of your peace.

As you take this journey, know you will strive to keep peace, this is a continual process; let the Holy Spirit guide you. Peace is the product of faith, belief in that which is unseen. It takes strong will to maintain. Remember peace is drawn to you by feeling. Remain in your power. You are led by your decision; choose peace. With this decision comes persistence, by desire and passion, to live the ultimate life God has promised. A life of forgiveness and a life of love. You are content within your core. The overall sense of well being within you and through you, you gain a feeling of wholeness and totality. You are released from the darkness of your past, for it has brought light to your future. You are abundant in every way and your cup is filled. Let it overflow with blessings to others. You live out your purpose, content with who you are, grateful for what you have, peace in your heart and mind. Never before could you imagine such joy and happiness. Life is Good!
