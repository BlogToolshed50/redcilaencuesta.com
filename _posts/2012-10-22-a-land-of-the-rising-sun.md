A magic of the East has been always attracting the minds of the Western minds. For many centuries Japan was closed for the foreigners, but even it’s open now there still remains a mystery. Japan is a unique combination of the traditions and the latest technology achievements. You can never say for sure that you have understood this country and its inhabitants.

Japan has a lot to show. The main and the biggest city, the capital of Japan – Tokyo – can be the starting point to this orient country. It’s not only the Japanese biggest city, but if count with its suburbs, the biggest metropolis on earth. Despite high towers of the office buildings, the most up-to-date underground and railway trains, there still exist the remains of the Tokyo long history. Ancients temples and palaces are the main tourist attractions in the Japanese capital. However the Tokyo citizens like to visit places too. Sensoji Temple, Meiji Shrine, Sengakuji Temple, Yasukuni Shrine, Zojoji Temple – just to name a few. Among all the existing palaces the Imperial palace occupies a very special position. The current Imperial Palace (Kokyo) is located on the former site of Edo Castle in a large park area surrounded by moats and massive stone. It is the residence of Japan&#8217;s Imperial Family.

The best season to visit Tokyo is spring when the cherry blossom creates a mystique atmosphere. One of the things (except the beauty of the nature and the magnificence of the cultural heritage), which attract a millions of tourists to Tokyo – is shopping. Yes, this Orient city has become one of the world’s fashion Meccas comparable to the best European and American destinations.

The former Japan capital, Kyoto is also worth visiting. It was the emperor&#8217;s residence from 794 until 1868 and survived a lot of troubles and disasters. Countless temples, shrines and other historically priceless structures still exist and are being saved. One the most impressive structures is Imperial Palace. It has lost its Royal status but not his beauty and glory. Kyoto is still considered to be the cultural capital of Japan.

Osaka, with its population of 2.5 million, is Japan&#8217;s third largest and second most important city. What to see there? Osaka Castle, famous entertainment and shopping district of Minami, Umeda Sky Building, National Bunraku Theater, Osaka Aquarium.

Those who are interested in not so distant history could be interested in visiting Hiroshima and Nagasaki – two cities having become the targets for the atomic bombs in 1945. Both these cities have museums devoting to these events.

Those who are fond of nature should visit Daisetsuzan – the biggest National Park in Japan. It’s situated on Hokkaido – the most Northern and the second largest island in Japan. As Japan lays on the isolated islands its nature is interesting and unique. 

When you come to Japan you surely shouldn’t miss &#8211; Mount Fuji, one the most popular and wide known symbols of the country. Fuji is a Japan&#8217;s highest mountain with a dormant volcano, which most recently erupted in 1708. The best view of the Mount Fuji opens from the train on a trip between Tokyo and Osaka.
