Success requires transformation.
  
Transformation requires decision.
  
You must decide exactly what you want.

Imagine how you want your life to be six months to one year from now. Create a clear and concise picture of where you want to be and why it is important to you. You want to be emotionally connected to the picture as this will assist you in following through with your decision no matter what obstacles you face. On a scale of 1-10 it has to be closer to a 10 than a 1. To live the life you truly desire you must dedicate yourself to your purpose and give up the good, short term, to have the great in your life long term.

One of the most important aspects of all the success that I have created in my life came through the power of the mastermind. It could be someone you know personally or a successful person like me who enjoys assisting those who truly have the desire to achieve greatness in their life. Your mastermind person should be someone who can relate their story to you and how they accomplished their successes. This is what put me on my path of living a truly inspired and empowered life.

Creating a specific plan of action would be the next step on your fast track to success. Your plan of action will create a path for you to follow on your journey. It’s important to be time specific, objective and realistic. This will keep you on task. Dividing your big goals into smaller incremental goals will make them easier to obtain and will empower and encourage your efforts.

Now for the fun part, visualize the outcome you are seeking. Take time daily to create a clear picture in your mind of how your life will be once you have achieved your goal. What will your life look like? How would this assist you in achieving your most desired dreams and goals? Visualize it as detailed as possible.

It is important to evaluate your progress and make adjustments as you go. This will keep you on track. How effective is your current plan of action? Is it moving you toward your desired result? Make adjustments along the way until you figure out what works best. Be sure to acknowledge what you do well. Celebrate your successes along the way and remember there are no small successes. Celebrate them all! Giving yourself rewards will assist you on your journey to your final aspiration.

One of the most difficult things for people to do is be patient and flexible throughout this process. This may seem trivial but it’s the most important step. Everything does not always happen in our time frame however if you stay consistent you will continue to make progress in the right direction. Don’t be tempted to give up because it’s not happening as quickly as you’d like. I have learned that it’s not our business when things will actually happen…it is just our responsibility to keep putting one foot in front of the other until the ultimate outcome is achieved.

If there is one thing that is constant in life, it is that life is always changing. Change is continually happening with or without us. In order for us all to move forward in life and achieve our ultimate dreams and goals/aspirations we must be willing to change.

“It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.”
