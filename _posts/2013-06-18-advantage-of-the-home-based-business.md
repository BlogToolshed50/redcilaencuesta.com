Going into business is not as complicated as it used to be. There was a time when planning a business meant calculating the cost of renting an office, furnishing it in the traditional way, and staffing it with at least a receptionist. These were the benchmark minimums for a professional business start-up. No more. You can begin this way:

Select the part of the country from which you wish to offer your services.

Make that decision totally independent of the existence of a job opening in someone else&#8217;s company.

Transition your way to successful self-employment without the costs, complications, and risks of a traditional business start-up.

Invest in modern business and communications technology that will make your business easily transportable to your ultimate geographic location.

Live a combination work leisure life style of your own design.

This more flexible, less capital-intensive, and less risk-laden approach to starting a business is the direct outgrowth of the home office option.

The contemporary economy is driven more by the services of skilled people than by the brawn of workers toiling in smokestack industries. There is burgeoning opportunity for people who have experienced the traditional workplace, understand how it functions, are literate in its terminology and technology, and yet are perceptive enough to identify needs that can be met independently.

The future belongs to the work force&#8217;s more flexible members. People with the insight and independently valued skill to do so are stepping outside of organizations. Often, they turn around and serve the needs of the large businesses they left, but they do it with more creativity, profitability, and satisfaction as home-based business people.
