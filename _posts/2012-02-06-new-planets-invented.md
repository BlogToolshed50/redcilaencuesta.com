The study-of the solar system and outside it is continuing with the advent of the technological revolution where many advanced telescopic instruments come to the rescue of the space scientists. The recent confirmation by the Kepler space telescope mission has revealed that there are 26new planets outside the solar system. Indeed, they are found to be orbiting very close to their hosts stars in order to sustain the life. According to the scientists, the temperature on their surface is estimated to be around 464 degree Celsius. Since 2009 the number of new planets found outside the solar system has in fact doubled.

The Kepler program scientist at NASA, they have come across about 500 exo-planet in the whole sky. In just &#8217;2&#8242; years they could discover about 60planets and more than 2300 planet candidates. In their study it is confirmed that the galaxy is loaded with planets of different and all sizes. As we all know, Kepler is the first mission initiated in search of earth like planets orbiting stars similar to our sun. As an ordinary citizen, we may expect that such explorations bring on earth the needed solace for the better living of the lives on earth.
