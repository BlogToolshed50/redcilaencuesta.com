The recent news item in a daily divulged the fact that the adults gain as much as one pound a year in their weight as they age. This is found to be caused by changes in their diet habit and more inclination towards extra servings of the food items like, potato chips, sugar sweetened drinks and low fibre breakfast cereals. The decreased in take of fruits and the vegetables lead to addition of weight by the recent study..

Even a small change in the eating habit leads to the weight gain as confirmed by the study by Dariush Mozafarian at Brigham and Women&#8217;s hospital. People who made the most unhealthy dietary changes gained four pounds of weight in four years. We should ensure that we do the needed physical exercise to avoid the addition of weight. In addition, it is found that, taking alcohol is also yet another factor leading to the weight gain in his study.
