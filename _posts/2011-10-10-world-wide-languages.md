We find lots of languages in this world. Recently I stumbled upon the fact that Chinese language be the top most spoken by as many as 1.21 billion people in the world. Followed by the Chinese language you may wonder to know that the Spanish is the language for as much as 329 million worldwide. Taking the third place, English remains the medium of communication for about328 million in the globe. While Arabic is spoken by 221 million around the world according to the data available.

But it is natural that a particular language slowly vanishes when the speakers find that a new language coming to the area is more useful and important. It may be an interesting statistics that, the 3500 least used language account for 0.2 percent of the world&#8217;s population. And 83 most widely spoken languages account for about 80 percent of the population. Some time people were coerced to give up their language by the rulers in the history leading to the demise of the language.
