Various marine lives have their own peculiar characters as revealed from the studies done recently. You will be surprised to know that, the dolphins sued to whistle to greet the other one. The marine biologists found out this behavior in their research on the dolphins. Even few species of dolphins like Bottlenose dolphin is capable of copying the noises and can also invent them according to the studies. During the recording of the dolphins swimming in St Andrews Bay by researchers from the University of St. Andrews through the use of hydrophones these aspects was revealed.

According to the marine biologists, the dolphins are found to swap whistles when the group of dolphins meet each other. The forensic analysis revealed that the whistles are of individual nature and are not copied by each other. The whistles of each dolphin is not found to be matching with the other one. One more peculiar observation by the researchers is that, one particular signal came from the leader of the group to OK the other dolphins to join the other group. It looks like they are practicing this whistling habit to hunt for food even as presumed.
