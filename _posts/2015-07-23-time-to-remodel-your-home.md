Remodeling your home can be a daunting task and devoting quality time to make your house a home can be a challenge any time of the year. If you&#8217;ve been thinking of remodeling, now is a great time to freshen your home&#8217;s appearance and make it more energy efficient.

It&#8217;s a good idea to inspect your home now. As you do this, ask yourself these questions:

* Do I have high heating and cooling bills?

* Is my current siding rotting, warping, fading or discontinued?

* Can I hear outside noise when the windows are closed?

* Do I have excessive heat gain in my home from the sun? 

If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you might be in the market for a home-remodeling job. Knowing where to start can be very important. You might be wondering: Can I do a project like this myself or should I leave it up to the professionals? How much is this going to cost?

Here are some tips from ABC Seamless Siding on how to choose a contractor:

* Ask for references and visit some of the homes they have remodeled. Ask questions while you are there, too.

* Check credentials and find out how long they have been in business. Are they a member of the National Association of Home Builders? Are they up to date with their licensing and insurance?

* When it comes time to sign the contract, go over it thoroughly with the contractor and discuss any final questions with them before signing it. 

Remember, quality is never cheap and the lowest bid isn&#8217;t always the best. It may seem like a headache at first to do research, but it will save time and money in the long run.

Once you&#8217;ve chosen a contractor, prioritize your projects.

With the rising costs of heating or cooling your home, the best place to start might be making your home more energy efficient. The U.S. Department of Energy says one-third of a home&#8217;s air leakage comes from the walls, floors and ceilings.

One of the best ways to make your home more energy efficient is to install seamless steel siding. ABC Seamless, for example, can install its seamless steel siding year-round. Since it has the strength of steel, it is not vulnerable to extreme cold or heat. Vinyl siding expands and contracts greatly with changes in temperature, which limits its installation to certain times of the year.

Each home sided by ABC Seamless is wrapped with a blanket of Energy Star approved insulation before the siding is installed. With the increase in heating and cooling costs, this added insulation can save you money year round. The seamless steel also eliminates ugly seams and is virtually maintenance free.

Home remodeling can be a big project, but if you hire professionals, you can save a lot of time and effort. And an investment in a home-remodeling project now can save you money for years to come.
