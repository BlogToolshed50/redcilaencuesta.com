Various economic indicators help the nation to know about the impact of them on the growth of the economy. The potential output is the maximum level of output that an economy can sustain without creating the macro economic imbalances. Any deviation from the potential output leads to the output gap, which is used in measuring the economical health of the country. The policy makers of the globe always depend upon the movement of the output gap to decide the monetary policy.

As revealed in various studies, the impact of a crisis on potential output and its persistence may not be the same across the countries. In fact, Japan had suffered persistent output losses following the banking crisis in the 1990s. On the other hand, Mexico and Norway recorded faster recovery and higher post crisis output. If the potential output loss is permanent, the nation has to address it with appropriate structural constraints.
