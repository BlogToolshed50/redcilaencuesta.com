Everyone says that we should convert the challenge and storm in our life as an opportunity to succeed. The great visionaries and leaders capitalize on crisis and see it as an opportunity to develop and enhance their survival and leadership skills. I read elsewhere that the Eagle takes the storm as the opportunity to fly high without any strain and we as human being should also have the ability to anticipate the impending storms and navigate the same to our benefits when it strikes.

Victor Frankl conceptualized and agenda and a vision to pull him through the tortuous days when he was confined in the Concentration camps during the Adolf Hitler period. He decided to do some meaningful thing, learn something new and take forward this unavoidable suffering and use it to help the humans. He could develop a Psycotherapy known as &#8220;Logotherapy&#8221; while in the camp to help the people to face such sufferings. You will be surprised to know that he could with stand the holocaust and was conferred with 29 honorary doctorates from various Universities around the globe for his works on the Essential analysis and Logotherapy. In fact, it is not the burdens of life that weigh us down, but it is how we handle them.
