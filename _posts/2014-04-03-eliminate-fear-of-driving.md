Eliminating a &#8216;fear of driving&#8217; is virtually impossible without &#8216;forward moving actions&#8217;. Many people go through a lot of tremendous difficulties with a fear of driving involving starting out and continuing to take action. This behavior affects every day of our lives.

Taking no action at all most often results in overwhelming circumstances. Everyone does this at one time or another and it can be halted and corrected. And we often defend our in-actions with irrational reasons to convince ourselves (and others) that we don&#8217;t need to take action. Why do we make it harder for ourselves to achieve success when there is so much that we can do about it?

Positively taking &#8216;forward moving actions&#8217; does remarkably start to immediately eliminate driving fears. At first it might only eliminate a small amount of fear but more opportunities and advantages will be presented to us thus accelerating the process as long as we keep taking action.

Eliminating a fear of driving is like the first steps of a baby. Before we ever learned to walk by ourselves we started out with zero skills. Everyone went through a certain phase of their lives where they must stand up and take those first few actions. After successfully taking action time and time again, we learned to walk on our own and were able to go places we had never been before. But we didn&#8217;t give up! We kept walking and practicing and getting better at it. The same is with eliminating a fear of driving or any fear for that matter.

The benefits of taking “forward moving action” are as follows:
  
-Progress: we learn to develop and move forward in achieving our goal
  
-Accomplishment: we accomplish something, resulting in increasing our confidence, control, and self esteem.
  
-Positive vision: It allows us to remove the negative thoughts that we create when we don&#8217;t take action. It cleans our minds to think more positively.
  
-More Action: Taking action allows us and encourages us to take even more action. It helps us grow and develop even more skills.

One of the best things in “taking action” is that we are able to do more, and we have considerably more actions to now choose from. This is especially true with eliminating driving fears, since there are thousands of opportunities to build skills once those first actions are taken and built on.

Where we often make it more difficult is thinking that there is only one &#8216;correct&#8217; action to take. Every problem has more than one solution and there is always one better answer. Taking action whether it’s the best or not is better than taking no action at all. It is also important to know the difference between positive actions and negative actions, as well as &#8216;forward moving actions&#8217; and doing the same old actions. Knowing this difference requires self-honesty and it’s our own responsibility to build these particular traits.

The things that we’ve learned here so far will help each of us obtain different skills and knowledge thus eliminating fear. But it is imperative for us to know that it is up to us to take the next step in our lives. Those simple steps and actions will positively lead us to bigger personal developments and achievements today and for the immediate future.

Before ending this chapter about “Forward Moving Action” to eliminate a fear of driving, I want you to know that everyone has their own actions to take and no two people are at the same place in their personal evolution. There are people who can take actions that others are not ready for. That is OK! There is no need to stress and pressure yourself about this. Doing so only creates more negative thoughts, fears and inaction. People have different sets of skills (due to past actions). The idea is to learn about where we are at personally and develop and build from there.

Start experimenting with your skills. Start eliminating your fear of driving one action at a time. Just keep moving forward. The world has so many possibilities. As long as we start and continue taking “forward moving actions”, we will be successful in eliminating any fear we want.
