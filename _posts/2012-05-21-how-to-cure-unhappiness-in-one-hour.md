There are some days when everything seems to be going wrong. You knock your water glass over as you reach to switch off the alarm, there&#8217;s no coffee left in the coffee jar and when you stand on the scales you&#8217;ve put on two pounds, despite the fact that you only ate lettuce leaves yesterday! We have all experienced days which start like this and we all have our own pet phrase which we mutter to ourselves whilst it is all happening; &#8220;typical&#8221;, &#8220;why can&#8217;t I get anything right?&#8221;, &#8220;what have I done to deserve this?&#8221; Sometimes, things just get on top of even the calmest and most laid back person around. All you want to do is to go back to bed, and start the day again.

Oh, to be able to rewind the clock, to just pick up the clock, take hold of the winder and turn it back an hour! We all think of this, we all wish for this but it doesn&#8217;t happen. The day continues and your temper becomes steadily more frayed as the litany of disaster unfolds. What on earth can you do to stop it, to halt this negative progression through the day?

There is, in actual fact, a simple way in which you can change your feelings, and hence your experiences, and it takes moments to put into place. The human mind is a tremendous thing and it is amazingly adaptable. People say that we women have the prerogative to &#8220;change our minds&#8221;. In actual fact we all, men and women alike, have the power to change our minds. We can choose how we think about something and hence how we feel about that something. We can quite literally &#8220;turn a blind eye&#8221; or &#8220;a deaf ear&#8221; to things; we can &#8220;sweep things under the carpet&#8221; or &#8220;turn our backs&#8221; to whatever it may be.

The problem which many of us have is that whilst these abilities kick in inadvertently, we haven&#8217;t worked out how to use these mental skills with intent. These are mental skills, and very powerful they are, and empowering too. Just think how much happier you would be if you could intentionally &#8220;turn a blind eye&#8221; to everything that would otherwise upset you?&#8230;The water glass tips over and you just think &#8220;oh well, it&#8217;s just water. It won&#8217;t stain, it will dry quickly&#8221;". That already feels so much better. You reach for the coffee jar, find there is none left and think that orange juice is much better for you in any case, whilst jotting &#8220;coffee&#8221; down on your shopping list. Better again. And then you weigh yourself once a week instead of once a day!

I think we all know that this is how we would like to think, that you would feel a lot happier if you thought in this way, but just don&#8217;t know how to make the mental changes necessary. It is all too easy to get stuck in a rut in the way we think, and instinctively we react in accordance with these old and familiar patterns. But these do not lead to happiness. If you are feeling unhappy and you want to change you have to learn to access the inner workings of your mind. Then you have the ability to change these old, deep rooted patterns of thought, reactions and behavior.

If your reaction of frustration, anger or unhappiness is one which &#8220;pops out&#8221; instinctively, unbidden and unbeckoned by your conscious and logical mind, then it is a habitual pattern of thought, one which is powered by subconscious thought processes, based upon prior experience. We tend to think that we are forever enslaved by such patterns, that this is just &#8220;how we are&#8221;. Yet this is untrue. You can change anything you want to, so long as you are willing and so long as you know to use hypnosis to access your subconscious mind. Hypnosis has the power to make you happy!

You need hypnosis, because hypnosis is a natural state of mind which allows access to your subconscious mind. If the pattern of behavior you wish to change is driven by subconscious forces, it follows that you must access your subconscious mind as a starting place. You don&#8217;t enter a race mid way &#8211; you start at the starting line! You can learn to use hypnosis easily with the help of hypnosis downloads.

Once in hypnosis you have the power to change how you think. Hypnotic suggestions can be given to guide you to respond to situations and circumstances in a way which will allow you to feel happy and to fully enjoy life. Hypnosis downloads can be used to guide you to feel healthy, happy and successful.

Everything in life starts with how you think about it, whether that thought is conscious or springs unbidden from your subconscious. As you learn to control and direct your thoughts with the help of hypnosis downloads you will be in control of your feelings and emotions. You can learn to turn unhappiness into happiness in a very short time frame. You really can learn to be happy in just one hour, with the help of hypnosis.
