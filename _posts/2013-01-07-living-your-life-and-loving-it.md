All of us, I am sure, wish for a life of abundance, health and wealth, relationships and what have you. There are those who are born with a silver spoon and blessed with good fortune throughout their lives. Luck seems to go with them wherever they go, well at least most of the times. Others are not so lucky and have to put up with challenges after challenges in their embattled lives and problems keep cropping up from time to time. To them, life is nothing but suffering.

To quote the revered and his holiness, the Dalai Lama, “Life is suffering. Our purpose in life is to seek happiness”.

What if there is a choice that we can make to turn things around? What if the unpleasant events and circumstances that we faced in the drudgery of living can be mitigated, lessened or dissolved with efforts on our part? Is hardship and adversity seems insurmountable? Can destiny be altered in our favor?

Yes!

The answer to all the above may shock you but just thing for a minute – Why is it that God made us the way we are? Each of us is unique and yet we are all the same – nobody’s perfect! Do we wait for divine intervention or some miracles to happen before we hope to see the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow?

Not if we can help it!

At birth, we are given a set of pillars to be our foundation and it is up to us to build upon them. Our destiny code is ingrained in these pillars but the power to steer the hands of destiny is within our control albeit measured.

Herein unfolds the 3 steps to strengthen our pillars.

Get Empowered!

We empower ourselves by knowing our

- strengths and weaknesses
  
- affinity and detachment
  
- characteristics and eccentricities

Our pillars of destiny contain the hidden factors that govern our success in life and how the above are played out depends on how we make use of these factors:-

- Self
  
- Output
  
- Wealth
  
- Influence
  
- Resource

All the above factors are interdependent on one another and how we use them holistically is the key to maneuvering destiny in our favor. This is the concept of the Chinese metaphysical science of Astrology known as the Four Pillars of Destiny.

Energized Yourself!

We are all affected by our living environment. The place we live, the location our house is sited, the landscape in our vicinity and the internal space within our home are channels where energy or life force known as “Qi” flow. This energy gives life to all living things and is dispersed by the wind and gathers at the boundary of water. The Chinese called it “Feng Shui” which simply means wind and water.

This energy wax and wane through time and is inclined towards certain compass direction and location. If properly tapped, it gives prosperity and harmony to the inhabitants of a property in terms of health, wealth and relationships. The secret is in identifying, locating, containing and tapping into this energy using the Chinese compass known as the “Luo Pan”.

Be Proactive!

&#8220;Action may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action.&#8221;

This is the quote by the British Statesman and literary figure, Benjamin Disraeli.
  
How true! Everything that happened to us is a result of the actions taken by us or by others. If we want something in life, we have to take action, without it nothing happen. We can sit around and bemoan the sad state of affairs we are in or we can be proactive and start making positive changes to our lives. The choice is ours to take.

If destiny hands us a raw deal, we can make lemonade out of a lemon!!!
