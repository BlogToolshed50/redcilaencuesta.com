It is vital to have online presence as an entrepreneur but a lot of people find that websites if not utilized to their maximum potential as beneficial as they could be .Costs have to be kept to a minimum but not at the expense of quality . These days with the emergence of web building software that is so user friendly you do not need any expertise in web-design to create you own good quality site . Its brought down the cost of being online significantly .
  
Past the creation jargon once you have your site comes the uphill battle to get traffic . Then coveting the traffic into sales. A lot of sites are very well technically done but at times people design them tend to forget to consider the end user perspective .The sites would be working well and have all sorts of graphics in terms of technical know how the designer knew his stuff.The problem was in terms of finding what you wanted it would not be at all practical which means potential customers would probably end up going else where .
  
I noticed that some people do not cross market their websites . The following are just some basic cross marketing tips .
  
• Include your URL on your business cards
  
• Include you URL on your letterhead
  
• Offer some stickers be it car stickers or fridge magnets with your URL
  
• Include your URL in your voice-mail message
  
• Include it on all the packaging you use
  
• Put it on all envelops you use
  
• Include it in you adverts as well as business directories
  
• Staff uniforms .

In offline advertising giving something for free like key holders, umbrellas with you logo and URL usually goes down well .But care should be taken in choosing which product to brand cause I have seen with T-shirts quite a lot of them are never worn hence the desired effect of advertising not archived .
