I read elsewhere that, it hardly takes three minutes to put some on off for life. Learning to manage the impression you make is a skill worth learning early on in business life. The world of work is crammed with opportunities to make a professional impact. In our experience, many intelligent and well educated people fail to make the impression to succeed in the business if they put themselves and their ideas across badly. 

It is highly essential that one should know about the impression management, which is very vital to achieve most of the goals in our life. According to the management gurus, you must resolve the conflict and keep the team optimistic to impress them and work towards the objective of the organization. A degree of assertiveness can easily impress others and you can see through the target vary fast with all the ease. Try to impress others with your appearance, cloth, communication skills and clarity of direction to win over them and take the team along with you to reach the objective.
