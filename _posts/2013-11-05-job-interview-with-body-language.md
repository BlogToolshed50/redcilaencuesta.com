When you are being interviewed it is very important that you give out the right signals. These can be provided by your positive body language.

Body language is a very important part of any communication. Body or non-verbal language might be defined as &#8220;what we say without saying anything&#8221;.
  
Much of the impact you create at interview is based on your non-verbal presentation. While words can deceive &#8212; many people don&#8217;t mean what they say or say what they mean &#8212; body language is subconscious. Since it&#8217;s less controlled and more spontaneous, it shows our true feelings and attitudes.

Here are some interview body language tips:

Handshake:
  
Shake hands firmly, but not too powerfully and look straight at the other person. Make sure your palms are clean and dry. Through your handshake, face, eyes and body at the same time, consciously try to communicate to the interviewer that you are glad to meet them.

Hands:
  
Don&#8217;t over use your hand gestures when you are talking. Try answering an interview question in front of a mirror to help you understand how much you move your hands while talking. Donâ€™t cross your arms as it can make you appear defensive. Let your hands lie loosely on your lap or place them on the armrests of your chair.

Eye Contact:
  
Good eye contact is essential and is an excellent way of conveying your interest in the job. Maintain natural eye contact with the interviewer &#8211; but don&#8217;t stare or look away too much. If you are uncomfortable with this kind of body language, look at the interviewer&#8217;s nose as it has the same effect. With panel interviews, look at and answer the person asking the questions, with a glance from time to time at the other interviewers.

Facial expression:
  
A smile is the most positive signal you can give. In most cases, a gentle, pleasant smile should do the trick. Too much of a smile that never softens can look forced and nervous. A pleasant smile with a twinkle in your eyes will convey the impression that chatting with you will be a pleasant experience.

Posture:
  
Reflects enthusiasm and self control. Sit reasonably upright with both feet on the floor, lean slightly towards the interviewer. Slouching or leaning too far back in your chair might give the impression that you are not that interested in the job. Sitting on the edge of your chair might give the impression that you feel uncomfortable. Listen to what the interviewer is telling you, use appropriate listing cues such as nodding, saying Mmm etc. Try to look interested at all times. Don&#8217;t rub or touch your nose. This suggests that you&#8217;re not being completely honest.
