The first consideration to be given when collecting rare or antique books is the safe keeping and storage. Whilst this may seem obvious, it is essential to consider these few points in order to ensure the longevity and safe keeping of any collection. The starting point is how the books are to be kept. The considerations to be looked at are as follows:

Shelving The appointment of the shelving within a room is important, in an
  
ideal world it should be a minimum of 3cm away from any given wall to allow the circulation of air. The wall should not be an outside wall as this can encourage damp. The shelving should be robust and not sag in the middle when fully laden. The shelving would ideally be adjustable so books can be stored upright and central to the shelve, again to promote air circulation. Solid book ends should be used to keep the books upright and tightly stacked, not too tight as this can cause damage when gaining access. Large and heavy books can be stored flat but not stacked on top of each other as this can damage the spines.

Humidity and Temperature Dampness within books encourages mould, however, too dry and the paper can become brittle. The ideal temperature would be between 60-70Â°F.

Light Direct sunlight is the biggest single contributor to book damage (second only to water). Paper will decay and fade if not protected. Books
  
should not be stored or subjected to direct sunlight. Your storing room should have the curtains or blinds drawn when not in use.

Infestation There are several critters that are attracted to the component parts of books (starches, glues and paper) such as silverfish, book lice, cockroaches, bookworms, rats and mice. The tell tale signs are small piles of brown dust or bite marks. If you observe any of these symptoms then you should consult a pest control expert immediately.
