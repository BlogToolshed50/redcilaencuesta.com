In the modern age, travel is such a large part of people&#8217;s everyday lives. In fact, given today’s fast-paced lifestyle, it&#8217;s hard to imagine that not so long ago, the idea of going on vacation was a rare luxury rather than a growing necessity. And, as the travel industry across the world has boomed, so too have the number of different types of vacations people in America are taking.

These days, holidays often revolve around a theme: skiing holidays in Lake Tahoe or Colorado are common, as are shopping holidays to some of America&#8217;s most famous malls.

Take a trip to the Deep South on a food travel excursion and you&#8217;ll find a wealth of fine foods to sample and enjoy on your vacation.

Anyone interested in embarking on food tours through the USA should also explore the culinary realms of New England on their excursions.

And people visiting New England today will be able to taste this special lobster in one of the many roadside lobster shacks that adorn Maine’s coastline.
