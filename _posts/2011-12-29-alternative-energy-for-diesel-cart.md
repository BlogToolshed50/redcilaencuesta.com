When the hydro carbon fuel price is going sky high and the pollution menace is increasing day by day leading to the global warming, everyone is looking for the alternative and safe source of energy. The recent article on the hi-tech electric trams in the place of diesel powered carts at the amusement parks in South Korea is a vivid example of the way the research is heading towards.

The trams are powered by the strips beneath the road, which are recharged and the power is stored in the battery or any other equipment to run the carts. These online electric vehicle is charged through the non contact magnetic fields below the road&#8217;s surface. Even the battery size needed is just 20% of the normal requirement under this technique. In fact, the small size batteries reduces the need for major recharging. We should aim at using such technologies in the public transport system employed in long haul.
