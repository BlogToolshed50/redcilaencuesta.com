The Basel Committee on the banking reforms has been introducing so many standardized tools to ensure the smooth functioning of the banking sector around the globe. The bitter experiences during the financial turmoil faced by many nations in the yester years have made them devise their own strategy to arrest the repeat of such disastrous situation leading to the stunted economic growth. The internationally applicable standard to ensure the liquidity of the bank for at least a short period at the time of specific shocks is devised by Basel recently.

One among the tools, is the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) which aims to promote more medium and long-term funding of the assets and activities of the banks. This ratio establishes a minimum acceptable amount of stable funding based on the liquidity characteristics of an institution&#8217;s assets and activities over a period of one year. This is to complement the liquidity coverage ratio and reinforce other supervisory efforts. If these types of international standards are implemented by the local banking regulators in letter and spirit, we may be able to avoid the banking failure and ensure sustained economic growth for the better human life.
