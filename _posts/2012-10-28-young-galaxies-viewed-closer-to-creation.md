When you receive the Seal you are not yet perfected. You are &#8220;young&#8221; compared to the maturity that will perfect you as years pass. Just like your own youth is the youth of galaxies astronomers have found recently.
  
When you are sealed God writes His Name upon you. When you bear God&#8217;s Name you anticipate years of growth to become worthy of God and show His glory to the world.
  
Some of the glory of God is being shown to the world right now&#8211;glory that is from &#8220;out of this world.&#8221; And yet the glory of the observable Heavens can tell us much about the grandeur of God and His creation.
  
An international bunch of astronomers finished a project they planned for years. They had the difficult task of securing the world&#8217;s largest telescopes all night every night for almost 2 weeks.
  
And that is how long they looked at one small little section of night sky&#8211;92 hours in that one place. This had the effect of letting a photograph expose for quite a long time. They could see very faint objects from very far away.
  
These objects are thought to be &#8220;teenager&#8221; galaxies or &#8220;baby&#8221; galaxies. They are considered proto-galaxies, the beginning of galaxies which will mature into the adult galaxies we know of today.
  
Light seems to us to travel quickly. But it takes a long time to travel the vast distances of the known universe. The light caught in the eye of this study is reputedly 11 billion years old or more.
  
That is a long time. Longer than man can easily comprehend. But it is an indication of the promise of eternity. Forever is much longer than 11 billion years. Forever is infinite.
  
This light 11 billion years old is light from only 2 billion years after the supposed Big Bang, the theoretical even when the universe exploded into being. Light this old is from when galaxies were still forming.
  
This study is going to tell scientists a lot about how the universe formed. This is good knowledge to have since it will help us understand God&#8217;s creation of the universe, and knowledge of God&#8217;s creation can only help people.
  
And scientists consider this finding to be &#8220;unprecedented&#8221; in magnitude. Never before have astronomers been able to look back at the building blocks of galaxies, which requires considerable depth of observation.
  
The research is planned for publication in the March 2008 issue of the Astrophysical Journal, and will resolve some heated arguments scientists have had for 30 years about the origins of the universe.
  
But you know that the ultimate origin of everything is God. He created the universe and the little world we now call home. Looking far back in time is an awesome experience giving a sense of the scope of God&#8217;s infinite nature.
  
And it is more than just an experience. The more we understand about how God created the universe, the more we can use that knowledge to benefit us in the present day. Science will solve a lot of problems.
  
Speaking of solutions, God wants you to solve a problem right now. The problem is that you have not always been close to Him, and this is the generation of the devil. But you can change all that today.
  
You can get closer to God today and experience some of the awe of His creation and His everlasting Presence. You can win the victory over the devil and get closer to God by receiving the Seal.
