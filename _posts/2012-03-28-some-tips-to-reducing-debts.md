If you are currently reeling under an enormous burden of debt, try to get counseling from the experts. There are people and institutions specializing in credit counseling or debt advice. Here is a look at some debt advice tips:

Handling Credit Cards &#8211; There really is no need to have too many cards. If you have got too many of them, call a credit card issuer and check out their current interest rates. Ask if they offer a low rate. Then, apply for a new credit card to consolidate all your debts. Doing this means you make payments to only one lender. If you concentrate on doing this right, you will be free of this debt too.

Taking up a home equity loan &#8211; Taking a home equity loan will provide you with the finance you require to pay off debts. Once you pay off your debt, you only have to pay off the home equity monthly payment, plus the interest. Check that these are not too high. Most often people who seek home equity loans are also making mortgage repayments. One must ensure that the burden of two loans won&#8217;t be too high. So look into this as well.

Reorganize your finance &#8211; Make a list of all your sources of income. Then monitor where and how your money is going out. This gives you a clear picture of where money is being spent unnecessarily. If you make sure to reorganize your finances and do some planning, you could save quite a bit of cash. Follow the plan strictly and pretty soon you will money channels directed towards debts rather than spending and soon you will become debt free.

Contact a settlement company &#8211; If you were to avail of the services of a debt settlement company, your creditor would be paid off and you would have to just pay back the settlement company. I have spoken to people who have approached debt settlement companies. They claim that debt settlement helped them become debt-free in no time at all.

Other means &#8211; You can get into refinancing and pay of high interest debts and then pay of the debt you owe to the refinance company at a lower rate of interest. This low interest rate will free up some money to help you get back on your feet. Another option is to take a loan on your retirement funds to pay your current debts. In such a case, you will not have to reveal your credit score at all.
