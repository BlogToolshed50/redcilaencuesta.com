The present day youngsters are are more frustrated and lacks the tenacity to face the problems of life. The major reason for their behavior is found to be their addiction to the drugs. They are more vulnerable to drug abuse and mood disorders because the brains function differently when they are enjoying themselves, scientists have suggested. According to the latest study, more neurons were activated in adolescents&#8217; brains when they received tasty treats, meaning they over-processed rewards and became vulnerable to addictive or impulsive behavior.

This could explain why youngsters take more risks and tend to develop disorders like addiction, depression and schizophrenia, as reported in the Daily Express.&#8221;Adolescents often respond different from than adults towards peer interactions and pleasurable stimuli,&#8221;as conformed in the study by Professor Bita Moghaddam, with doctoral student David Sturman of Pittsburgh University in the US. They said that recognizing the difference in brain processes of adolescents was critical to understanding this phenomenon, as well as their behavioral and psychiatric problems, such as drug abuse and mood disorders.
