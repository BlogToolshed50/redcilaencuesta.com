In human life, everyone is craving for success. But few of us only possess and imbibe the needed vital traits for the success. As I come across in the life of many successful people, the three vital traits that concern many to the success be determination, Passion and Commitment. The &#8220;never-say-die attitude always helps the person to realize even the distant dreams. The determination shown by Srilanka cricket team in the 1996 world cup brought them the glory of the winners of the cup though the world expected some on else to take the trophy. The determination to sail with the wind some time and against it often will bring the needed success in our life as tasted and learn from the people with glory of reaching the pinnacle of success. Even the non ideal situation can be turned to in your favor, if the needed determination is shown in the deed you proceed.

Passion is the fire in us that propels us to ensure the needed excellence while doing the job. The enthusiasm arising out of the passion gives the needed energy to the person to proceed towards the goal until the logical end. Beethoven, one of the greatest composers the world has seen was very successful in his field, despite the fact that he was deaf, but with lots of passion. It is a rare quality that helps the person to achieve the goal set before him. The Dedication shown as the Commitment adds the impetus to the other traits to go on the right track to face the challenges and come out victorious in all our deeds. In all the human should try developing to these vital traits to reach the goals in the life and live happily.
