This guest post from Doris Dillon

I&#8217;ve been weighing the pros and cons of getting the DISH NETWORK but I just don&#8217;t know. on one hand I probably watch way too much TV as it is and I need to cut back but on the other there are just some really cool shows that I don&#8217;t get with my basic cable package right now. I love working from home but I feel like I waste a lot of time channel surfing when what I could be doing is really taking charge of the remote and finding something good to leave on in the background so I don&#8217;t have to think about it again and can just get out the computer and work. I love being at home all day but the TV is the closest thing I have to a coworker and I don&#8217;t know what I would do without the low noise in the background all the time. I miss having adult interaction during the day but I feel like the reality stars have sort of become my friends;
