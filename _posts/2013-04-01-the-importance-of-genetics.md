Genetics is a branch of science that deals on scientific examination of genes, heredity and variations in organisms. The use of genetic knowledge can be traced to early civilizations when people relied on genetic information to improve the productivity of domesticated species of plants used for food such as corn, wheat and rice, and the species of domesticated animals.

The genetic influences were applied not only to increase the yields of crops. The agriculturist of the old time used genetic knowledge to alter species and produce traits such as being resistant to diseases and pest, while producing nutritious and healthful harvest.

Even in the modern time, the use of genetics is helpful in areas such as medical care and human health. Scientists today consider the role of genes, including the defective genes, in their reaction towards drugs, with hope of providing the best and safest dose and type of drugs for illnesses, based on the patient&#8217;s genetic makeup.

The pharmaceuticals also have benefited from it since the inception of genetics. Around the world today, the people who are afflicted with serious genetic illnesses reach 5%. A few of the diseases which are believed to have genetic component are diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular, asthma and hypertension. This means, that offspring can have the likelihood of contracting such diseases.

Advances in molecular genetics allowed scientists to earn insights into the nature of serious illnesses like cancer. Likewise, they were able to come up with tools to fight many of these illnesses, and provide additional diagnostic tests.

In addition, through the knowledge on DNA and genetics, scientists are able to treat and prevent recurrence of Down&#8217;s syndrome and PKU, able to provide more effective antibiotics especially the antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

The field of bioengineering has been employing genetic knowledge to directly modify the genetic material of an organism through procuring new genes and new genetic traits. This is done by permitting the segments of DNA to be transferred to different locations or be removed from the DNA molecules. It is also examining the human growth hormone for treatment of dwarfism. Insulin, too, is a product of genetics through modified bacteria. In order to produce foods and drugs, they are synthesized from fungi and bacteria which have been manipulated genetically.

The human gene directs the construction and constitution of the cells. The genes are found on the DNA. One strand of DNA has thousands of genes which are in control of the human body and how what body parts are created. The DNA decides the color of the person&#8217;s skin, eyes, hair. It is also responsible for the physical and mental attributes of the person. A person is what he is based on his DNA. Even the sex is determined by the genes. And each part of the human body contains its own body pattern, the outcome of which is due to the genes termed as the homeostatic.

Genetics is among the frontiers of science in the modern era. Understanding its importance can lead to understanding of the organisms surrounding us, including the mankind.
