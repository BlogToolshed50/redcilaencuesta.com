We observe in the modern world that the expansion of the poultry farming is on with very high momentum in view of the increasing demand for the poultry products. The awareness among the public with regard to the nutritional value of the various poultry products too accelerated the growth of the poultry units. However, the waste from poultry units has started posing problem to the environment and health of the people in and around the farms. Especially, the disposal of the hatchery wastes has become an important health issue affecting the people.

In fact, there are numerous methods of disposal of the hatchery wastes like Egg wringing, rendering, fermentation, composting and land application. The hatchery wastes can also be used as the feed for the birds. As such, we can deal with the hatchery wastes by incineration, burial, composting and rendering. Proper legislative policies must be put in place for the adherence by the hatchery farmers for the disposal of the wastes in an environmental friendly manner without affecting the health of the people.
