How to create a perfect environment for getting a good nights sleep.

Your bedroom should be quiet and relaxing. Unwelcome noise or light, an uncomfortable or worn-out mattress and foundation, or a room that’s too warm or too cool can prevent you from getting the sleep you need. There’s no reason to settle for anything less than perfect sleep.

Make Your Bedroom a Sleep Sanctuary, arrange your bedroom furniture where it is out of the way, but accessible. Try and keep bedroom furniture tidy, so it doesn’t clutter the room.

Is your bedroom conducive to a good night’s sleep? Do you trip over the bedroom furniture when you try to get out? These factors can all make a difference:

Mattress and bed base

Be sure your mattress and the beds base meet your needs for both comfort and support. If you sleep with a partner, your mattress should also allow you both enough space to move easily. Similary, make sure you leave enough room between bedroom furniture and your bed.

Light

Light is one of the body’s most powerful time cues. The rising sun can wake up the brain long before the alarm goes off. A dark room is the most conducive for sleep day or night.

Noise

Sudden, loud noises from inside or outside the home can disrupt sleep. Steady, low sounds, such as the whir of a fan or air conditioner, are soothing because they help block out distracting noises.

Temperature

The ideal bedroom temperature is 60 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit (16 to 18 degrees Celsius). A room that’s too warm or too cool can disrupt comfortable sleep.

Follow these simple tips, arrange your bedroom furniture in a sensible way, and you’ll soon be getting a great nights sleep.
