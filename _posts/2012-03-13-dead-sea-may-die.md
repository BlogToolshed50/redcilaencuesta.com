Do you know that the &#8220;Dead Sea&#8221; had vanished some 120,000 years back?.Yes, the scientists are predicting that the chance of the giant lake may disappear are very bright in the light of the prevailing drought in the Middle East. As confirmed through the sediments drilled from the Dead Sea, the scientists have come out with the findings that the water is diminishing in an alarming pace.

If another period of drought continues in the region, the Dead Sea is certain to vanish as could be seen from the drained populations surrounding it. In fact, the water body is the lowest point on earth. It is 425 meters below the sea level. Dead Sea is highly salted and you can come across the sediments layer by layer. Since the fresh water flow is blocked to the Dead Sea, the chance of the survival of this great lake on earth is very bleak by the scientists.
