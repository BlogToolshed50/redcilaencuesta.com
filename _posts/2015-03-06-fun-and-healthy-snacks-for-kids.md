Looking for a quick and healthy snack for the kids? Here are a few tasty ideas that you can surprise them with, or let them make on their own.

1. Bugs On A Log: They&#8217;ll love it just for the name! Simply spread peanut butter onto celery stalks, and then top with raisins (the bugs). Yummy.

2. Melon Balls: Show them that ice cream scoops can be used for more than just ice cream. Scoop the &#8220;meat&#8221; out of watermelon, honeydew, and cantaloupe and serve them on a tray with colorful toothpicks in each one.

3. Quesadillas: You don&#8217;t have to drive to a Mexican restaurant to enjoy these melted treats. Simply sprinkle shredded cheese onto a tortilla. Fold the tortilla in half and microwave it until the cheese is gooey. Cut the quesadilla into triangle-shaped wedges and dip in salsa.

4. Frozen Grapes: The entire family will enjoy this cool treat once summer arrives. Place a washed bowl of grapes into the freezer for an hour or so. Don&#8217;t forget to cut the grapes in half for smaller children and toddlers.

5. Peanut Butter Squares: Kids will eat just about anything that&#8217;s covered in yummy peanut butter! Spread peanut butter onto a cracker (or a rice cake). Add a couple of apple slices then top with another cracker to form a little cracker sandwich.

6. Snackers Delight: Children change their minds with the wind, so be prepared with a medley of their favorites! Fill each cup of a muffin tin with different treats such as nuts, raisins, cheese cubes, pretzels, carrot slices and sunflower seeds.
