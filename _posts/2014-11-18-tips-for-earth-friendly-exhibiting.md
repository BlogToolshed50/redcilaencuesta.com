The environment, global warming, overflowing land-fills, sky rocketing energy prices; these words have become part of our everyday language. As have earth friendly solutions, recycling, sustainability & corporate or social responsibility.

Today&#8217;s market place is going green. It&#8217;s all around us green initiatives are on everyone&#8217;s mind; am I doing enough, could I be doing more? Consumers are starting to pay attention to earth friendly companies, and businesses that want to make a difference in the world are choosing to go for the green.

Whether your interest in the environment is purely from social responsibility or if increased pressure in the market place is driving your decision or a little bit of both, adopting green practices can only enhance your companies brand image. Going green gives you something to talk about and puts you ahead of the competition.

10 Tips for going green:

1. Building a booth or looking for banner stands? Use earth friendly materials such as bamboo. Bamboo is a renewable agro-forestry product and the fastest growing plant on the planet. It is a viable replacement for wood and metal as it has a rapid maturity cycle of 3-4 years and it provides a critical component in the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

2. Determine longevity &#8211; for long term exhibits pick materials that will not weather or degrade quickly. For short-term displays use materials that are easy to recycle or reuse.

3. Use recycled material increase the sustainability of your exhibit by using as much recycled, reclaimed or rapidly renewable material as possible. The process of recycling aluminum takes about much less energy than it does to create new aluminum form ore. When you are finished with your exhibit recycle it make sure it doesn&#8217;t end up in a landfill.

4. Print Green &#8211; make up banner and signs with water-based inks on cotton fabric or bio-degradable plastics. Biodegradable laminates, water based adhesives, recycled paper for brochures and promotional materials all contribute to a greener planet. Go for the green with giveaways avoid items that come in plastic packaging (unless biodegradable) or plastic items (unless recycled). Instead choose re-useable items such as pens, mugs or cotton tote bags.

5. Eco-accessorize &#8211; don&#8217;t forget about flooring, racks and other accessories. Bamboo flooring and literature racks promote sustainability too.

6. Energy efficient lighting &#8211; LED lighting reduces energy use by up to 90% over conventional sources. Incandescent bulbs are inefficient and emit only 10% of the energy they use as light the rest is given off as heat.

7. Detoxify &#8211; Chemicals, sealants, vinyl and paints all have a direct negative impact on the environment. Oil and latex-based paints are toxic to the environment, evaporate into the air and contribute to global warming. Look for non-VOC paints, stains and PVC-free carpeting, water-based or low-VOC padding and adhesives.

8. Lighten Up &#8211; modular and portable exhibits tend to be lighter than custom displays. When shipping think about using lighter materials and less packaging materials. Buy locally to further reduce shipping and delivery.

9. Refurbish &#8211; give your old exhibit new life with earth friendly materials such as cotton graphics. Using exhibits that can be easily changed rather than replaced will mean less consumption of materials over time. Keep your exhibit in good repair and replace broken or damaged parts.

10. Use suppliers that not only offer green options but also operate with environmentally conscious conditions such as waste reduction programs and recycling in-place. Be sure to ask your supplier for more advice on how you can create an earth friendly display for your next exhibit.

Going green doesn&#8217;t have to cost a lot of money. There are many more options available today and the list keeps growing. Green, recycled and earth friendly materials can cost less than their non-recycled counterparts. Research your options and know that every little bit counts from using recycled paper to printing biodegradable banners you can be rest assured you are making a positive contribution toward greening the planet.
