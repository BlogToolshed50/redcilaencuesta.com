The phenomena of wage-price spiral is affecting most of the developing countries nowadays. When the wage is increased the input cost goes up and ultimately the price of the final product witnesses an increase. The upward wage revision in any institution results in the increased disposable income in the hands of the receiver. This in-turn leads to inflation.

In fact the wage -price spiral increases the inflation in the country aggravated by the short supply of the commodities. Inflation driven price rise again leads to the demand for the improvement of the wage in all the sectors and hence the spiral effect. It is for this reason that most of the nations are implementing wage cut and introduce the austerity measures much to the dislike of the working lot. The nation should tackle the issue on the supply side to combat this issue effectively according to the advice of various leading economists.
