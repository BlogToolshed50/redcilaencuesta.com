Learning is a wonderful thing. My mother always told me that children are like sponges, you can teach them just about anything, and they usually remember it. Here are a few books your children can absorb.

THE ABCS OF FOOD: A Study of Food as History, Story, Tradition and Nutrition by Louise Ulmer and Richard S. Calhoun published by e-Books on the Net (http://www.ebooksonthe.net) is a delightful book where readers can search from A to Z for all kinds of foods and spices. This book is a dictionary/encyclopedia/guide, and it is fabulous. Readers can also find out how to pronounce, collect information on, and make specific foods. This book will keep you busy for days, weeks, even months. Teri Sloat&#8217;s FROM ONE TO ONE HUNDRED published by Scott Foresman publishers is a wonderful book, designed to help children count to 100. There are more than 2,500 eye-appealing objects arranged so each page drips with fun characters and brilliant color.

More wonderful books my children and I have recently read include ON BEYOND A MILLION: An Amazing Math Journey by David M. Schwartz. Children will be proud of themselves when they realize just how high they learn to count. This book was designed almost as a comic strip style book because of the text set in balloons. Readers can easily learn the English number system taught to them by multiples of ten published by Random House: Dragonfly Books. MY SPIRITUAL ALPHABET BOOK by Holly Bea and published by HJ Kramer: Press was a treat to read. The bubbly illustrations and vivid text will fill kids with laughter. Not only will the children reading this story, learn the alphabet, they will also learn the changing of the seasons and the importance of Gods gifts.

For a fun book your children will just love. Try FROM LETTER TO LETTER by Teri Sloat. Each page is a different letter of the alphabet. Children will enjoy searching the pages for items that begin with a specific letter. Along the bottom of the page, Teri Sloat includes the whole word, giving the reader an extra method of learning that specific letter. Those interested can find this book at your local bookstore or through Puffin Unicorn Books or online at Sloat&#8217;s web-page.

As an adult, I know that my mother was right, and I, too, tell my children the same exact thing. In Illumination Arts&#8217; April release, INSIDE OUT, a little girl named Karly learns the same thing from a spirit who comes in the form of an invisible friend. This book with dazzling illustrations by Roberta Collier-Morales was a pleasure to read. Get your copy from Illumination Arts.com.

In case you didn&#8217;t know paper format isn&#8217;t the only way to find high-quality books from talented authors. Books on CD, as download or on diskette, known as e-Books or electronic books, are a growing popular form of book reading especially for children&#8217;s books. Why? Because publishers are now able to add movement (animation) and sound clips to their books. Children don&#8217;t only read e-Books, they interact with them.
