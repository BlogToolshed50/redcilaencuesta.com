1. Let the child choose his or her own lunch box or reusable lunch bag. Encourage the child to add decorations, too. 

2. Children like finger foods. Cut chicken, cheese, or meat into bite-sized pieces for easier handling. 

3. Sandwiches don&#8217;t have to be boring. Use a variety of breads and fillings. Cut sandwiches into squares or triangles, or use cookie cutters to cut out fancy shapes. 

4. Insulated containers make it possible to keep foods hot or cold until lunchtime. Soup, casseroles, and salads are interesting alternatives to sandwiches. 

5. Muffins, biscuits, rolls and bread sticks are all good substitutes for slices of bread. 

6. Pack fruits and vegetables ready to eat. Peel and cut them at home, if necessary. Vegetables can be cut into strips, chunks, or flowers. Try including raw vegetables such as yams, sweet potatoes, broccoli, and cauliflower. 

7. Lunch &#8220;treats&#8221; don&#8217;t have to be cookies or candy. Raisins, peanuts, popcorn, and pumpkin or sunflower seeds are fun to eat and provide more nutrients.
