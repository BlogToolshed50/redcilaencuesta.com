One of the news item in the internet disclosed the availability of the &#8220;rare earth&#8217; on the floor of the Pacific Ocean. The Japanese scientists confirmed that as much as one square kilometer of the available deposits found there will be able to provide one fifth of the current global annual consumption. The sea mud extracted by the scientists from the University of Tokyo and the researchers from Marine Earth Science and Technology in this region found to contain various minerals.

Metal Yttrium was found from the sea mud taken from the depth of 3500 to 6000 meters from the sea surface. According to the estimate the rare earth amounting to 80to 100 billion metric ton is available in this deposit compared to the global reserve of just 110 million. The extraction of heavier rare earths like, gadolinium, terbium and dysprosium found in this deposit can be used to manufacture LED valves, hybrid cars and TVs. Since the deposit is found in the international water area, the concerned nations should come together to make use of the finding for the welfare of the world&#8217;s population.
