Wildly, extraordinarily, and outrageously celebrate every success in your life.

The more you celebrate your achievements, the more you remember them; and the more you remember your successes, the more confidence you have.

You really need to celebrate your accomplishments. I find it interesting that people can be successful but not feel confident.

I was doing a couple of back-to-back seminars in Japan. The staff, of course, had to arrive earlier in the morning and stay later in the evening than anybody else. Basically, nobody gets any sleep.

We had two days off before there was another seminar exactly like the one we had just finished. My staff asked me if they were allowed to go home during the two-day break. I told them that they couldn’t go home. They were all quite shocked.

I told them that we were having staff training and a “staff stretch.” They didn’t say anything, but I could tell they were not pleased about being required to stay.

The seminar came, and we finished the first event.

I told my staff that I wanted to meet later at 11 in the morning for staff training and a stretch. I let them know that it would be the most difficult activity they had ever experienced.

At 11 o’clock all of my staff met in the room. I gave them a list of items and told them that they had 30 minutes to gather the items on the list. All of the items were important for success in the task they were going to be assigned. If they were unable to find an item within the 30 minutes, they would have to do without it.

After the 30 minutes had passed, we got in vans and traveled all day to the mountains near Tokyo. It was beginning to get dark outside. I continued to tell them that it would be the worst night of their lives.

We eventually arrived at Hakone, a beautiful resort with hot springs. My staff thought the resort might be our destination, but we drove right past.

I told them that we would soon arrive at our departure point. Nobody had the courage to speak. We turned left, passed a few trees, and pulled into a parking lot.

When the door of the van opened, a beautiful Japanese woman was standing there in a kimono. She bowed and said, “My name is Mayumi. I will be attending you during your stay.”

Everyone on my staff was in total shock. I had arranged for my staff to spend the two days at the old summer home of the Imperial Family.

That is an example of wildly celebrating. It is something they will never forget.

As you wildly celebrate the success of each event you complete, of each product you deliver, of each time you exercise successfully, and each time you follow through on your commitment to wildly please somebody who is important to you, you will develop the confidence necessary to help you be successful in every area of your life
