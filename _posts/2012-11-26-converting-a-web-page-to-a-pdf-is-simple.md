Here at our office, we love the Firefox browser. The innovative tabbed browsing system that Internet Explorer has finally adopted in IE8 is just one of the many advancements Firefox brought to the table when it was first launched in 2004. Interestingly, the most useful change is also one that hasn&#8217;t been embraced by other browsers as fully: the introduction of plug-ins or extensions. Extensions are supplemental programs that enhance your browsing experience, modifying Firefox to make the management of the information you&#8217;re viewing less complicated. Some plug-ins offer powerful advertisement and pop-up blocking options, others allow web developers to test their code right in the browser, and some enable you to scrape information from a website and save it in a different format.

One such extension well look at is Web2PDF, a neat little tool that allows you to convert any web page you&#8217;re viewing into a PDF format. This is especially helpful if you&#8217;re hoping to distribute the information gleaned from that particular website to multiple people. With Web2PDF, all you have to do is convert the page to PDF format and distribute it accordingly.

Once the extension has been installed, you&#8217;ll have the ability to begin converting those page. Looking at the top of your browser, you&#8217;ll notice the addition of a button associated with the task. After you&#8217;ve decided to convert the page into a PDF, you&#8217;re tasked with just pressing that one button. Upon its submission, you will observe the conversion process.

Upon completion of that process, the tool will prompt you to download your new PDF.
  
Simply right click and designate a location to which you&#8217;d like the PDF saved.

As you look at the directory in which the file has been saved, you may notice that its file-name corresponds to the web-page from which the content was taken.

The appeal of being able to save web content this way may be difficult for some users to see, but there are many uses for this file type. PDF files work flawlessly across different systems, even PCs and Macs, meaning its one of the simplest ways to share information with a large audience. PDFs offer advantages to work places as well, because their format makes them easy to print and doesn&#8217;t involve all the hassles of trying to print from a website. Saving a PDF of information found online also ensures that this will be available to you even if something should happen to the website, such as the owners allowing their domain registration to lapse, intentional changes to the content that is available, or server failure on their part resulting in the loss of content.

If you&#8217;re one of those people who is wary about installing too many extensions on your browser, Web2PDF can be accessed directly. You can visit their website where you will notice a field where you can enter the URL of the web page you would like to convert.

For anyone who is looking for a better means of saving the information you read while browsing the web, this is a simple way to do so
