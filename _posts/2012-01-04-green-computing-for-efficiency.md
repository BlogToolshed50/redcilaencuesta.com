Green computing or Green IT refers to the environmentally sustainable computing or IT, which is more environment friendly. The green computing involves the practice of designing, manufacturing, using and disposing of computers, servers efficiently and effectively with no impact on the environment. In order to keep the environment clean and healthy, it is a must that green computing covers all these above areas in the future with needed regulations from the authorities.

The goals of the green computing is to maximize the efficiency of the product and its lifetime without affecting the environment. It aims at promoting the re-cyclability and degradability of the used and defunct computer products apart from the factory waste. We can reduce the energy cost through the lower usage and efficient operations of the equipment by resorting to the green IT. This can also reduce the carbon emission. While the IT sector is growing phenomenally, it is a must that we go in for the green IT in a big way to improve the efficiency and work with the nature.
