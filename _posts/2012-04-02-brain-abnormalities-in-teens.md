It is indeed a matter of concern that Australian scientists have found that the brain abnormalities make teenagers more likely to smoke cannabis. According, to their study of more than 100 Melbourne teens the uptake of cannabis harms the brain confirming the previous research on damage caused by long-term use of the drug. The researchers from Monash and Melbourne universities took high-tech images of the brains of school students when they were 12 and analyzed their addiction to this drug.

When the researchers checked the scans taken when those students were 12, they found a part of the frontal lobe area in their brains was smaller than those in teens who steered clear of cannabis. Lead researcher Prof Dan Lubman said the students with abnormalities in the orbito frontal cortex &#8211; the brain region involved in memory, reward and decision making &#8211; were more prone to using cannabis.&#8221;What we found is that only the orbito frontal cortex predicted later cannabis use, suggesting that this particular part of the frontal lobe increases an adolescent&#8217;s vulnerability to cannabis use,&#8221; the Herald Sun quoted him as saying.
