It is indeed a matter of great interest to know that the fruit lies use cues from the natural skylight to navigate. In fact, these flies are found to possess this special capability according to the recent research. The study undertaken by the professor from the University of Washington has proved the fact that insect to look up at the sky as we do while lying on our back. The researchers at the California Institute of Technology have found that insects such as monarch butterflies and locusts maintain a constant heading while migrating thousands of miles across continents.

According to their discovery, the bees and ants hunting for food successfully find their way hundreds of feet back to nest, without a problem due to the quality of possessing a compass of sorts. While examining the behavior of Drosophila melanogaster commonly called fruit fly it is found that they orient themselves based on the visual landmarks. The result of the study indicates that the Drosophila has the ability to coordinate eye and brain functions for rudimentary navigation using light polarization patterns, the researchers concluded. It is the natural behavior of the insects to use the light to reach their destination as we do.
