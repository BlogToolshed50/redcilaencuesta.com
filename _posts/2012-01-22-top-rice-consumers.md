Most of the global population depends on various cereals like rice, wheat, and the more for their sustenance. It is a matter to be noted that the rice is the second largest produced cereal in the world. One may be surprised to know that, rice is cultivated in more than 100 countries. The rice industry is worth about USD 120 billion per Annam. It records a growth of 2 -3% annually.

I read elsewhere that 50% of the global rice consumption is accounted at China and India. In fact, most of the Asian countries are finding the place in the major consumers of this cereal. Countries like Indonesia, Bangladesh, Vietnam Philippines, and Burma also find a place in the list of major rice eaters.

The statistics shows that as much as 435 million tones of rice was produced globally in the year 2008â€”2009. Another interesting feature I read in a publication indicates that the 10 major consumers of rice are the 10 major producers of this cereal in the world. In fact, China alone accounts for 30 % share in the global rice production.
