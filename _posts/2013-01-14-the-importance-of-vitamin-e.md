One of the most important vitamins for the body is Vitamin E. In order for the heart to stay healthy the body needs plenty of Vitamin E. Vitamin E is also an excellent option for helping limit bad heart conditions.

The most important aspect of Vitamin E is the protection of cell membranes from free radicals. The body is more prone to certain diseases if it doesn’t have a proper amount of Vitamin E. Without the protection of Vitamin E free radicals will damage the cell membrane. Since Vitamin E is fat soluble it is absorbed and stored in the cells. For this reason the cell membranes allow Vitamin E to pass through.

Depending on a person’s weight they will have different daily Vitamin E requirements. The more fat a body has then the cell membranes will need a higher amount of Vitamin E for proper function. Wheat germ, nuts and vegetable oils all contain Vitamin E. However, this is often not enough so it is recommended that people take Vitamin E supplements.

If you have a lack of Vitamin E it can often take months or years to see the effects. Damage to the spinal cord is the biggest result of Vitamin E deficiency. Sometimes in severe cases damage can result to the retina of the eye. In order for the body to absorb Vitamin E foods should contain a small amount of fat.
