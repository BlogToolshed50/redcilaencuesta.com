It has long been acknowledged that it is easier and cheaper to get more business from your existing customers than it is to get any business from somebody who has never done business with you.
  
Your customers already know you and their business is more profitable for you because there is no advertising cost involved.
  
A referral system, up-selling and back-end selling are all worth trying if you wish to increase the income you get from your customers. They can be used for marketing online or offline and they cost little or nothing to put into practice.
  
It is a good idea to instigate a system of getting referrals from satisfied customers. The referral system can generate a lot of profitable sales which are relatively easy to get. A customer survey can be used to gain referrals and it can be sent out by post, email, fax or put it up on a web page.
  
Suggested questions could include:

What did you most like about our product or our service?

What could we do to improve our product or service for you?

Do you know anyone who would want our products or services?
  
The first questions focus on the benefits you provide and your customer is more likely to give you referrals when they think about those benefits.

Answers to the first question can often be used as a testimonial if your customer agrees. The second question could give you a warning of a problem which needs to be addressed.

Up-selling can be achieved when your customer is buying from you. You do not have to wait until you have made a sale to increase the income you get from a customer. While you are collecting the ordering information from your customer, offer them an opportunity to purchase a better quality product or service or add another item to the order. You could offer them a special price which is only available if the customer buys it straight away. Customers are often willing to accept an attractive offer especially when they think they are getting a bargain. Up-selling offers can even be included on your web site.

Many businesses make a lot of their profit from back-end sales or selling other related products or services to customers who have previously bought goods or services from them. After a person has bought from you once, it is relatively easy for them to buy again. To succeed with this approach, it is a good idea to look for companies who deal with goods or services which compliment yours. You can offer their products to your customers as long as you arrange to take part of the profit.

An Internet search can reveal several affiliate programs which offer goods or services similar to your product. All you need to do is tell your customers about the product and that you endorse the product. The owner of the affiliate program does the rest and pays you a commission for selling the product.

By using a referral system, up-selling and back-end selling, you should be able to get more business from your existing customers and generate more profitable sales without paying costly advertising premiums.
