When everyone is concerned about the food security in the world in the light of the depleting and unbalanced supply, we need to preserve the available food in proper manner. The recent research in the field of agriculture has shown that the Fermentation is found to be the effective method to preserve the food, which is healthier as well. In fact, it is the time tested and old form of bio technology helping the human being to conserve the scarce food items.

Fermentation is the simple transformation of the raw materials in to value added products by using the growth of the micro organisms. During the course of fermentation, the complex protein, fat and the carbohydrates in the food undergoes modifications due to the activities of the micro organisms present naturally. Fermented food is found to be good for the health as the process improves the digestibility of the food items. Even the nutritional value of the food gets enhanced in this process.
