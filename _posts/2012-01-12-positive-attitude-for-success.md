Attitude is found to be the best driver to achieve the desired result in our life as confirmed in our practical life. The greatest gift that we possess is that “we can alter our life considerably by altering our attitude”. Striving for excellence is a wonderful attitude which can help in bettering ourselves in every genre of our existence. Mediocrity is a very strange phenomenon. 

People often tend to be hooked with it. They start perceiving the world as a perfect place with every thing going just fine. Such people lead a diminutive life. On the contrary, people who think differently with positive attitude surge ahead in the life and reach the greatest height. The attitude to learn things takes a person towards excellence. As Steve Jobs said “Stay Hungry” and look for improvement. Stay foolish and keep learning for all round success.
