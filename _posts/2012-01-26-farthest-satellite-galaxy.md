The discovery in the field of space is infinite and the recent sighting of the &#8220;satellite galaxy&#8221; 10 billion years from the earth by the astronomers proves this point well. It is confirmed to be the lowest mass object detected at such a distance when compared to the earlier discoveries. The theory, it is predicted that galaxies should be surrounded by halos of smaller, satellite blobs of mass according to University of California, physics professor Chris Fassnacht, who aided in the satellite discovery.

Though the astronomers have detected such satellites around our own galaxy, the Milky Way, and nearby, they had not previously detected the predicted satellites of more distant galaxies. The mass of galaxies is made up, not of stars, but of &#8220;dark matter,&#8221; which does not absorb or emit light and these distant objects found to be very faint or even completely dark. Hence, the recent discovery is sure to throw light on such galaxies for closer studies in the future. The technique employed by this team it sight this galaxy can be used to find out such galaxies easily.
