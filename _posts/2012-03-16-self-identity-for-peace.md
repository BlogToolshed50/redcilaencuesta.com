Of late the frustration and disgust are on the increase among the human folks. The confusion about the self identity adds to the problem in the lives of many. Everyone is found to be suffering due to the inferior complex or continuous feeling of inadequacy. All our worldly desires like to acquire wealth and position in the society is to efface such feeling of inadequacy. The behavioral experts, the long-term cure for such issue lies in understanding who we are and why we feel small. We conclude that the &#8220;self&#8221; is only body and mind.

This is found to be happening due to our emotional attachment with the body, which we feel as immortal. The fear of death occurs due to our attachment with the body and the misconception that the body is immortal. If one thinks that the body is mortal and the &#8220;self&#8221; alone is vital than the understanding about the self prevails over everything and the sufferings due to the so-called inadequacies will vanish. In fact, the sages affirm that the body allows your &#8220;self&#8221; to reside within along with even the disease causing organisms. A clear understanding this ethical and philosophical aspect may bring enlightenment in our lives.
