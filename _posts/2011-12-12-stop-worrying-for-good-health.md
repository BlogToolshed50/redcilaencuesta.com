It is very easy to say &#8220;stop worrying&#8221; but very difficult to practice for most of us in the life. Experienced people offer an excellent visualization technique in this aspect. If you are worrying about something, picture the words of your worry on a piece of paper. Now ignite a match to the paper and watch the worry dissipate in to flames. Bruce lee, the great man of martial arts said to have employed this technique to ward off the worry.

One should master in compartmentalizing the worry. Set aside a certain amount of time to ponder over a problem and map out an effective plan of plan of attack and your options. Once this is done, have the mental fortitude not to come back to the problem and go over it again and again. Make the mind as your servant to overcome the worry. The more you flex your muscle, the more it will become stronger.
