Modern life is faster and more stressful than ever. To cope, many resort to dreaming of their happy childhood days. But for a surprising number of people, this kind solace is unavailable. Childhood can be a very difficult time. Children experience stress just like adults do, and this needs to be recognized. Family conflict, domestic violence, divorce, constant school changes, new neighborhoods and child care arrangements, peer pressure, and bullying all contribute to childhood angst.

Here are a few things that parents can do to help their children deal with stress:

* Monitor and modify their own stress levels

* Keep communication lines open. Let your kids know what&#8217;s going on

* Encourage friendships by scheduling play dates, sleepovers, and other fun activities

* Remember that children need quiet down time to as well as time to play
